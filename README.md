Build a simple RAG system that extracts relevant information from a PDF, stores it in a vector database, and uses this database to retrieve contextually relevant data to generate a response.
### Task Title: Implement a Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System Using PDF and Vector DB
### Objective:
Build a simple RAG system that extracts relevant information from a PDF, stores it in a
vector database, and uses this database to retrieve contextually relevant data to generate a
response.
### Requirements:
1. Extract text from a PDF document.
2. Store the extracted text as embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).
3. Retrieve relevant content from the vector DB based on a query.
4. Use a language model to generate a response using the retrieved data.

- Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY in run.py with your actual API key.
